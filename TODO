--- new (gsb2) stuff
make sure that working copies are ALWAYS cleaned up if there is an exception
when creating a bridge
maybe need begin/rescue in new_bridge, clean up, and re-throw


--- end new (gsb2) stuff
Don't hardcode release number in SVN_ROOTS.
X BUG - local_wc directory is not named unambigously, so if there is  a bridge for release and 
devel versions of 'pkg' they will try to use the same local working copy name. FIXFIXFIX (fixed - verify)
X Lock critical sections (git/svn commit/push hook response) so only one process can run them at a given time
(partial) More verbose page after you make a bridge that describes next steps
Testing - ensure history prob doesn't happen again
(partial) Better commit messages on both sides
? Include all git commit messages since last push in svn log?
handle manual merging 
X allow non-empty github repos to be bridged
make sure all commit messages that svn sees are at least 10 characters (or complain to whoever
wrote the commit message) -- hmm, since commits from git get the git author added in the svn commit message, this may not matter.
X? avoid extra round trips / break the circle
binary diffs
Make sure we don't respond to pushes if they are not pushed to master! (may not be possible or important)
when creating the bridge, add URL: <github-url> to DESCRIPTION (comma separated list is ok - make sure web site rendering supports that)
make sure merge emails are sent when there is s conflict
    and that merge functionality works
    also, if commit is from some other svn or git user, need to make sure the email goes to them
README.md (rst?) implications?
handle github errors like this:
    running command: git clone git@github.com:dtenenbaum/gitsvntest0.git 2>&1
    result code was: pid 3627 exit 128
    result was:
    Cloning into 'gitsvntest0'...
    ERROR: Storage server temporarily offline. See http://status.github.com for GitHub system status.
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
