Lock critical sections (git/svn commit/push hook response) so only one process can run them at a given time
More verbose page after you make a bridge that describes next steps
Testing - ensure history prob doesn't happen again
Better commit messages on both sides

handle manual merging 
allow non-empty github repos to be bridged
make sure all commit messages that svn sees are at least 10 characters (or complain to whoever
wrote the commit message)
