X Lock critical sections (git/svn commit/push hook response) so only one process can run them at a given time
(partial) More verbose page after you make a bridge that describes next steps
Testing - ensure history prob doesn't happen again
(partial) Better commit messages on both sides
? Include all git commit messages since last push in svn log?
handle manual merging 
allow non-empty github repos to be bridged
make sure all commit messages that svn sees are at least 10 characters (or complain to whoever
wrote the commit message)
X? avoid extra round trips / break the circle
binary diffs
Make sure we don't respond to pushes if they are not pushed to master! (may not be possible or important)
when creating the bridge, add URL: <github-url> to DESCRIPTION (comma separated list is ok - make sure web site rendering supports that)
make sure merge emails are sent when there is s conflict
    and that merge functionality works
    also, if commit is from some other svn or git user, need to make sure the email goes to them
README.md (rst?) implications?
